      Permaculture is a sustainable method of land management, focusing on the
      use of natural resources and the principles of ecology. It involves the
      development of perennial crops and perennial polycultures, the use of
      organic materials and practices, and the re-establishment of natural
      ecosystems. Permaculture works to reduce human impact on the environment
      while increasing sustainability and self-sufficiency.

    <h2>The 12 design principles of Permaculture</h2>
    <!-- made an ordered list  -->
    <ol>
      <li>
        Observe and Interact: Take time to observe and understand the natural
        patterns, ecosystems, and systems at play in the environment.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Catch and Store Energy: Harvest the energy of the sun, wind, and water
        in the form of renewable resources and store it in ways that make it
        available for future use.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Obtain a Yield: Utilize the stored energy to produce yields that can be
        consumed or used in other ways.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback: Use natural forces to help
        regulate the system itself and pay attention to the feedback the system
        provides.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services: Consider the entire
        cycle of resource use and find ways to use resources more efficiently
        and sustainably.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Produce No Waste: Utilize all resources that enter the system and find
        ways to reuse, recycle, or repurpose them.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Design from Patterns to Details: Consider the big picture of the system
        and the interactions between its parts before delving into the details.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Use and Value Diversity: Create multi-species habitats and maximize the
        potential of each species.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Integrate, not segregate: Create relationships between elements and
        maximize the benefits of each element.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Use Edges and Value the Marginal: Maximize the use of edges and the
        marginal areas of a system.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Produce No Waste: Create closed-loop systems to ensure no waste is
        created.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Design from Patterns to Details: Observe and learn from nature as a
        model for designing systems.
      </li>
    </ol>
