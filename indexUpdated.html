      Globally, around <strong>8 million</strong> people die each year from
      pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Also the average price
      for petrol has gone up by <strong>48%</strong> which is making it more
      unaffordable for the average person. Renewable technology is going to help
      us reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. There are some cons to using
      <a href="page2.html">renewable tech</a> as anything that needs to be mass
      produced will have an impact on the environment.
      <a href="page3.html">Permaculture</a> is an
      <strong>ecological design</strong> system which seeks to create
      sustainable human settlements and agricultural systems modeled from
      <strong>natural ecosystems</strong>. It is based on the principle of
      working with, rather than against nature.
