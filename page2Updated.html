          <td>
            1. Solar energy is a renewable and inexhaustible resource. <br />
            2. Solar panels require no fuel to produce electricity, so energy
            costs will be reduced. <br />
            3. Solar energy is clean and does not produce any emissions. <br />
            4. Solar energy is available almost everywhere, even in the most
            remote locations. <br />
            5. Solar panels are typically low maintenance and require very
            little upkeep.
          </td>
          <td>
            1. Initial setup costs for solar panels can be expensive. <br />
            2. Solar energy is dependent on the weather, so its availability is
            unreliable. <br />
            3. Solar panel efficiency can be affected by dust and debris. <br />
            4. Solar panels take up a lot of space, making them impractical for
            some locations. <br />
            5. Solar panels require direct sunlight to operate at peak
            efficiency.

          <td>Wind Turbines</td>
          <td>
            1. Renewable Energy Source: Wind energy is a renewable energy
            source, meaning it will never run out. It is also a clean source of
            energy, producing no hazardous waste or emissions. <br />
            2. Cost Effective: Wind energy is one of the most cost-effective
            forms of renewable energy, with some projects now able to produce
            electricity at prices lower than traditional fossil fuels. <br />
            3. Job Creation: Wind energy is a growing industry and provides many
            jobs in the construction, maintenance, and operation of turbines.
            <br />
            4. Space Efficiency: Wind turbines take up very little space and can
            be built on land or offshore, allowing for efficient use of land.
          </td>
          <td>
            1. Noise Pollution: Wind turbines can be noisy, especially when they
            are located close to populated areas. <br />
            2. Intermittent Energy Source: Wind is an intermittent energy
            source, meaning it is not always available when needed. This can
            make it difficult to plan for and rely on for consistent power.
            <br />
            3. Wildlife Impact: Wind turbines can have an adverse effect on the
            local environment.

          <td>Water Turbines</td>
          <td>
            1. Renewable: Hydroelectric power is a renewable energy source and
            produces no greenhouse gas emissions. <br />
            2. Reliable: It is one of the most reliable sources of electricity
            as it does not rely on the weather like other renewable sources such
            as solar and wind. <br />
            3. Cost-effective: Hydroelectric power is a cost-effective energy
            source that has a low operating cost.
          </td>
          <td>
            1. Environmental Impact: Hydroelectric power has a significant
            environmental impact, including the disruption of fish migration,
            alteration of river flow, and destruction of habitat. <br />
            2. High Upfront Costs: Hydroelectric power requires a large upfront
            investment, making it difficult for some countries and communities
            to afford the necessary infrastructure. <br />
            3. Location Dependent: Hydroelectric power is limited to areas where
            there is an adequate supply of water and the necessary
            infrastructure to make use of it.
